  - I'm a Computer Engineering student at the University of Isfahan. I've always had a deep love for computers, but my true passion lies in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Currently, I'm focused on expanding my knowledge in this exciting field.

Outside of academics, I find joy in playing the piano and dulcimer, and I'm an avid reader, particularly in the realm of philosophy. I also enjoy volunteering and helping others, especially when it comes to programming and learning.
